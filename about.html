        <h4 class="about-title">Hi, I’m Olivia, a Book Marketer & Book Strategist.</h4>
        <p class="about-info">I founded Olivia Book Specialist to support authors who want to promote their books
            professionally but feel overwhelmed by the marketing process. I understand that writing a book takes
            dedication, and my goal is to help ensure that your work gets the visibility it deserves.</p>
        <p class="about-info">I work with authors at different stages of their publishing journey, offering thoughtful,
            ethical, and personalized book marketing support.</p>
        <p class="about-info">My passion for books and storytelling inspired me to step into the world of book
            marketing. Over time, I’ve developed a strong interest in helping authors navigate promotion in a way that
            feels authentic and effective. As a growing book marketer and strategist, I focus on research-driven
            approaches, continuous learning, and staying up to date with book marketing trends. Every project I take on
            is handled with care, professionalism, and a commitment to delivering value.</p>
        <p class="about-info mission"><span>MY MISSION:</span> <br>To help authors confidently promote their books,
            build credibility, and grow long-term visibility in the publishing world through ethical and strategic
            marketing.</p>
        <p class="about-info mission"><span>MY VALUES:</span> <br>To be a trusted partner for authors seeking
            personalized book marketing solutions that align with their unique goals and values.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span>Integrity:</span> I believe in honest and ethical book promotion. I never use misleading tactics,
                spam outreach, or shortcuts that could harm your reputation as an author. Every strategy I apply is
                transparent, respectful, and focused on long-term credibility rather than quick wins.</li>
            <li><span>Personalization:</span> Every author and every book is unique. That’s why I take time to
                understand your goals, genre, and audience before recommending or implementing any marketing strategy.
                My services are tailored to fit your specific needs, not a one-size-fits-all approach.</li>
            <li><span>Professionalism:</span> Clear communication and dependable support are central to how I work. I
                value timely responses, organized processes, and respectful collaboration, so you always feel informed,
                confident, and supported throughout our work together.</li>
            <li><span>Creativity:</span>Your book deserves thoughtful and creative marketing that reflects its message
                and voice. I approach each project with fresh ideas and careful planning, ensuring that promotion
                enhances your story rather than overshadows it.</li>
            <li><span>Growth:</span> The publishing and marketing world is constantly evolving. I am committed to
                continuous learning, improving my skills, and staying updated with industry trends so I can offer
                strategies that remain relevant and effective for authors.</li>
        </ol>
